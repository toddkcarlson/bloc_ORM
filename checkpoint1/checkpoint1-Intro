For each of these skills, write pseudo-code (like the post = Post.all.first example above) to demonstrate how your application might perform these tasks through an ORM. For each code sample, also write a corresponding SQL statement. Send the code samples and SQL statements in the submission tab.

remove duplicates in a query response
filter records using inequalities, pattern matching, ranges, and boolean logic
sort records in a particular order
limit the number of records returned
group records into sections
perform calculations using aggregate functions
join tables using cross join, inner join, and outer join
